    "This year Bold Project will be climbing three Nordic peaks and descend them on their bikes within a week. These mountains are the highest mountains in their respective country; Halti in Finland, Kebnekaise in Sweden and Galdhøpiggen in Norway. Our aim is to raise a significant amount of money through Unicef for children in Ukraine affected by the war.",
    "UNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfil their potential, from early childhood through adolescence. And we never give up.",
    "The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the country’s 7.5 million children. Humanitarian needs are multiplying by the hour as the fighting continues. Children continue to be killed, wounded and deeply traumatized by the violence all around them. Families are terrified, in shock, and desperate for safety.",
    "The past eight years of conflict in Ukraine have already inflicted profound and lasting harm on children. Now, the threats to Ukraine’s children have only grown. By 10 April, more than 4.5 million refugees had fled Ukraine, more than 90 per cent of whom are women and children. Millions more people have been internally displaced. Such large-scale displacements could have lasting consequences for generations to come. Children fleeing war in Ukraine are also at heightened risk of human trafficking and exploitation. Meanwhile, attacks using explosive weapons continue to move closer to populated urban areas increasingly striking children’s homes, schools, hospitals, water systems, power plants, and places where civilians are seeking shelter.",
    "UNICEF is working with partners to reach vulnerable children and families with essential services – including health, education, protection, water and sanitation – as well as life-saving supplies."
