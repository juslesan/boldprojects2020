    "During the summer of 2020 Bold Projects returned to their running roots and this year’s aim was to run five ultra-marathons in five days. The project was quite spontaneous since Covid-19 struck in the midst of all. The members felt as though they had to commit to a project and continue their streak of projects. This led to the idea of Bold Offroad.",
    "Bold Offroad was the longest distance any of them was going to run in such a short period of time but it was also in other aspects the most challenging one. They had agreed on the destination for each individual ultra-marathon in forehand but it was up to the runners to orientate themselves in the best way possible all while carrying backpacks containing food and supplies.",
    "The “corona-spring” affected the mental health of the finnish population as well as the mental health of the members. This resulted in a fundraiser for Mieli who work for a more mentally healthy population. They offer help to those in need and maintain crisis helplines in many different languages.",
    "Since the project was a bit more of a spontaneous matter it allowed for more time for training and planning of details. Supplies, route and timetable were thoroughly planned and this led to the realisation that a support car was necessary.",
    "Joel Edström was contacted and was quite easily convinced to join the project as a chauffeur. This made it possible for the runners to only pack along the most necessary things in their backpacks and leave refills and extra supplies in the car for when needed. In the 11 litres large backpacks they packed food, water, raincoats, socks, first aid kit, speakers and a night lamp.",
    "July 25th was the official day the run began. In Hamina next to the largest flag in Finland the last preparations were made before Bernhard, Valtteri, Linus and Eddie began their journey. The destination was Salpalinja. Bernhard and Linus made a running pair and they chose to run straight through the forest. Valtteri and Eddie made another pair and also chose to run in the straightest line possible to their destination. After 5 km the second pair noticed that this tactic was much slower and more energy draining than running along roads and changed to a more suitable tactic.",
    "The first day was much more exhausting than any one of them had imagined. Already after 40 kilometres with the backpacks on they realized how much was left and how hard it was going to be. The five day long battle against the psyche had begun. After 63 kilometres Valtteri and Eddie arrived in Salpalinja. This could have been the finish line for an ultra-marathon but this was now only the first finish line of five in five days. Therefore none of the runners felt that good as they prepared for their first night of sleep. Eddie also noticed familiar pain in his knee and was worried for the coming days and if he would be able to finish the project. Bernhard and Linus arrived thirty minutes after the first pair and the quartet slept in tents in the middle of the woods in eastern Finland.",
    "The second day began with breakfast made over open fire and a dip in the lake next to the camping site. The pairs decided to run together in case Eddie wouldn’t be able to make it. During the day they ate and slept some more and in the evening at 6 p.m they started running again. The idea was to run during nights and evenings to avoid the very hot temperature during the days. Their legs were stiff and the tempo slow in the beginning but after a while the legs got used to it and they started to pick up the pace. After 20 kilometres Eddie felt pain in his knee again and after another 10 kilometres he realised he wasn’t going to make it to the finish line. They called Joel who came to pick him up and the quartet had been reduced to a trio. The trio continued running and at 3 a.m. they arrived in Kyykoski where they spent their second night after one of the most exhausting nights in their life.",
    "The third day continued for Bernhard, Valtteri and Linus who at this point had managed to run about 110 km in two days. Their feet were hurting, their heads were aching and the mosquitos surrounded them constantly but with a strong willpower they continued and managed to reach Repovesi national park after approximately 50 kilometres. All of them confessed that they had several times during the night thought about giving up.",
    "The fourth day was the turning point for the runners. Their bodies were hurting but now they felt hope again. A bit less than half of the overall distance was left and with this in mind they began running again. The night contained all the elements that had become the new usual for Bernhard, Valtteri and Linus: Never ending roads, mosquitos and a fight with the mind. But also good company, music that was played loudly from the speakers and a will to never give up. Approximately 50 kilometres later they arrived once again to the camping site.",
    "The fifth day finally arrived and only 50 kilometers remained. It was a hopeful group that woke up and started to prepare but there was also concern if they would all make it to the end since their feet and legs were hurting so much. The first 10 kilometres went well and soon enough they had run over half of the distance. When 20 kilometres remained they proceeded to walking because their bodies were in complete agony. After many long hours they started to see the top of the mountain of Neitvuori which was the last finish line. They picked up the pace once again and while singing and shouting in the otherwise completely quiet forest they arrived at the base of the mountain. Slowly they began to climb the 184 metre high mountain of Neitvuori. At the top of the mountain with a view over Hiidenlahti and the finnish forests they cheered loudly and celebrated the unbelievable journey they had just made.",
    "The project was their most demanding so far and to reach the destination after 245 kilometres felt unbelievable. The achievement was celebrated with champagne still at the mountain top and while the sun started to rise Bold Projects started to climb down the mountain. One last night was spent in the forests before they the next day returned to Helsinki by car. It was a tired and weakened group that sat quietly in the car on the way home but also a happy and proud group with another experience to their names and lots of new memories."
