              With the Bold Running Club we offer running experience four times a week. On Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday at 18.00 we welcome you to join us for a run. Running is more fun together with friends and we desperately need friends times like these.
            </p>
            <p>
            Beginners and experienced runners of all ages are welcome and it's obviously free of charge. Also, you don't have to participate four times a week, join us when you feel like it and as often as you like. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We like to vary the distances we run and you can see in the table below what distance we are running on what day. Running pace according to the runners. 
            </p>
